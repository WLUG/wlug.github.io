Since 2014 WLUG has been using GitHub as a repository.

At most meetings, after a presenter has delivered a slide show or demonstrated software, then files are stored on WLUG's GitHub account in the **meetings** repository.

Feel free to connect to this repository and look through past presentations: [WLUG Meetings](https://github.com/WLUG/meetings)
