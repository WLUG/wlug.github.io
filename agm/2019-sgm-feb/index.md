At 7:30pm on Monday, 25 February 2019, a SGM was held to discuss
proposed changes to the Wlug charter. A total of eight 2019 Wlug members
were present, thus quorum was met.

At the Wlug AGM held 2018-11-26] 
it was decided a SGM would be held in 2019 to discuss minor adjustments
to the current Wlug Charter of 20 January 2014. Ian Stewart provided a
document to everyone in attendance detailing the proposed changes. The
changes included:

  - Adjusting the AGM and SGM quorum statement to be: At an AGM, a
    quorum shall be 50% of the society membership, or 5 people,
    whichever number is smaller.

  - Remove statements from the charter that are now no longer
    applicable. For examples, the operation of a technical books
    library, e-mail accounts and the use of the Wlug seal.

  - Tidying up of the document layout by adding a table of contents and
    correcting the rules numbering.

After discussing the proposal the members unanimously voted for the
proposed changes.

The meeting closed at 7:50pm.

After the meeting Peter, Tony and Ian signed and initialled print outs
of the proposal and the updated charter documents. Ian will scan these
documents and up-load them to the Incorporated Societies web-site.
