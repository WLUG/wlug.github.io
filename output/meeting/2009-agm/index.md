## Minutes

It wasn't until 8:55 did we establish our present membership was 25
current members. 11 members were present at the meeting, and 2 were
contactable by phone and able to submit votes if necessary.

We established this was a quorum sufficient for electing officers and
proceeding with the meeting.

We approved the minutes of the past AGM, although with the understanding
that they were incomplete. Approval moved by Bruce, seconded by Liz.

Bruce gave a president's report, and outlines some of the things we did
in the past year, and some ideas/goals for the next year.

John Billings gave the Treasurers Report.

The ending balance for the 2009 year was $613.81.
