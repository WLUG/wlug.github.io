## Presidents Report

Meetup.com listing has worked well to reach new members. This is a paid
$15/year listing. For the past year it has been mostly a social club.
New members have brought new talks over the year.

With the completed financial report we can now apply to re-register as
an incorporated society and update our charter.

Plan for the coming year - get more members on board, possibly look at
software freedom day.

## Treasurers Report

Some corrections still needed to figures for subscriptions for
2010-2011. Tony to pass on documents to Michael to investigate
finalising so we can apply to-register. Many thanks to Tony for his
efforts preparing the financial report.

## Software Freedom Day 2015 Discussion

The Base could be the highest foot traffic, but possibly expensive? An
interactive demo or videos could work well.

Mailing list is chewing up some mail - post to mailing list to discuss
other options. Google groups may be an option. Chris has reserved
"waikatolug" Google Group. Display board/manned stand at the library
around software freedom day. Rene to investigate purchase of a travel
