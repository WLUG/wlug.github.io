## 9. General Business

  - Discussion was had regarding new user participation, specifically
    after installfests; points were raised that installs could be more
    automated, giving more time for teaching the basics of Linux use. A
    meeting dedicated to new users getting help could assist, but new
    users would have to be encouraged to widely advertise it.
  - WLUG itself isn't very widely publicised; members to investigate
    ways to change this.

Meeting closed at 8:44pm
