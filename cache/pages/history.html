<h1>History and General Information</h1>
<h2>Wiki</h2>
<p>In 2002 WLUG became an incorporated society and at the same time a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wiki</a> was set up to aid Linux and Open Source enthusiasts. At the time Daniel Lawson was the president of WLUG. Daniel continues to keep the <em>WLUG wiki</em> running on his servers.</p>
<p>Feel free to take a walk back in time and browse the <a href="http://wiki.wlug.org.nz/">WLUG wiki</a></p>
<h2>Creation of this WLUG Website</h2>
<p>This website has been created using the Python based <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> <em>Static Site Generator</em>. This is open source software and you may view the GitHub repository for the <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola">source code</a>.</p>
<p>The source files used for <em>Nikola</em> to build this website reside at the WLUG repository wlug.github.io <a href="https://github.com/irsbugs/wlug.github.io/tree/src">src branch</a>, while the website html files reside in the <a href="https://github.com/irsbugs/wlug.github.io">main branch</a></p>
<p>Those with access to the WLUG repository wlug.github.io may have a local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> folder that holds a copy of the source and main website files. These files may then be edited to enhance the website and using the <em>nokola github_deploy</em> bash command the files on GitHub are updated. </p>
<p>GitHub also provide web-hosting service and this WLUG website is accessed via <a href="https://irsbugs.github.io">https://wlug.github.io</a>.</p>
<p>Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME record</a> the DNS is able to map <strong>wlug.org.nz</strong> to <strong>wlug.github.io</strong>. Users connecting to <strong>https://wlug.org.nz</strong> will be unaware that they are connected to a GitHub hosted website.</p>
<p>Another feature of GitHub is that using a browser a change may be made to the website source code. For example a change of phone number. Upon committing the change, GitHub will run the Nikola updating process. After a few minutes the web-site will be updated. This is done by the <a href="https://getnikola.com/blog/automating-nikola-rebuilds-with-github-actions.html">workflow yaml code</a> in the src branch file .github/workflows/main.yml.</p>
