<h1>Github Repository</h1>
<p>Since 2014 WLUG has been using Github as a repository.</p>
<p>At most meetings, after a presenter has delivered a slide show or demonstrated software, then files are stored on WLUG's Github account in the <strong>meetings</strong> repository.</p>
<p>Feel free to connect to this reposirory and look through past presentations: <a href="https://github.com/WLUG/meetings">WLUG Meetings</a></p>
