<h2>Presidents Report</h2>
<p>Continued to make use of Meetup.com for wlug. Cost of this service is
US$12 per 6 months. Most popular presentations this year were by Baden
Delamore on system security. As yet we have not re-applied to function
as an incorporated society. Plan to do so in 2016. Wlug server was
compromised. Software has been re-installed, but not yet placed back
online. The wikipedia pages, wiki.wlug.org.nz, are being run from
systems of Daniel Lawson. Suggestion of more marketing of wlug around
the University for 2016. One meeting this year could not be held at
Waikato university as the room was booked for exam use. That meeting was
held at The Cook.</p>
<p>Peter moved, and Rod seconded the Presidents Report.</p>
<h2>Treasurers Report</h2>
<p>Tony presented the report for 2015. Wlug ended the year with a small
surplus. Tony has recently paid some expenses and needs to coordinate
with Rene and Chris on receiving reimbursement. The payment method to
Orcon for the domain name has changed from quarterly to once every 3
years. Tony will produce a 2015 financial statement such that it can be
submitted if we proceed with reapplying to operate as an incorporated
society.</p>
<p>Tony moved the report be accepted, and Roderick seconded.</p>
<h2>Review of Subscription</h2>
<p>Tony moved, Peter seconded that the subscription remain at $20.</p>
