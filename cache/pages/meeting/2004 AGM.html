<h1>9. General Business</h1>
<ul>
<li>Discussion was had regarding new user participation, specifically
    after installfests; points were raised that installs could be more
    automated, giving more time for teaching the basics of Linux use. A
    meeting dedicated to new users getting help could assist, but new
    users would have to be encouraged to widely advertise it.</li>
<li>WLUG itself isn't very widely publicised; members to investigate
    ways to change this.</li>
