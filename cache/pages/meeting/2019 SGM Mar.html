<h1>Amend Charter</h1>
<p>We inadvertently removed the Common Seal section from Rules at the SGM

Incorporated Societies Act of 1908. Peter proposed that the Common Seal
section be added back into the Rules. Ian seconded. Unanimously carried.</p>

<p>Ian proposed that Lawrence become our third committee member for 2019.
Seconded by Peter. Unanimously carried.</p>
<p>There was no general business and the meeting closed at 19:40.</p>
<p>After the meeting: Peter, Tony and Ian signed off on a printout of the
updated Rules for scanning and e-mailing to the Incorporated Societies
processing team.</p>
