<h1>Election of Officers</h1>
<p>Some discussion about voting methods. AlexHope observes that vote by a
show of hands is the only only method allowed in the constitution.
BruceKingsbury suggests that we consider amending this next year if we
wish to allow other voting methods.</p>
<p>In the end there was only one nominee standing for each position and
three for committee so a simple show of hands was quite sufficient.</p>

not existed long enough.</p>
