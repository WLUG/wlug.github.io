<p>The minutes for the 25 November 2019 AGM were read.</p>
<p>Peter moved the minutes be accepted as a true and correct record of the
meeting. Rod seconded. Unanimous vote</p>
<h2>President's Report</h2>
<p>Peter thanked our sponsors for 2020. These were Professor David
Bainbridge, Waikato University Computer Science Dept., for providing the
meeting room. <em>RimuHosting</em> for providing the hosting of our web-site and
Daniel Lawson for providing hosting for the WLUG wiki.</p>
<p>Also thanked were our members Tony, Jeff and Rod, for continuing to
provide the beverages and snacks at our meetings.</p>
<p>Also thanks to NZ Open Source society for allowing us to use the Big
Blue Button website to have video conferencing during the Covid19
lock-down.</p>
<p>Possibly in the future we could broadcast our meetings for those that
are unable to attend. Also, look into video recording of the meetings.</p>
<p>A variety of presentations were delivered at our 2020 meetings and
topics included: LISP block chain, Wireguard VPN new-kid-on-the-block,
Pine Book Pro, Android ROM flashing, virtual examination of various
distros (GhostBSD, EndeavourOS, Ubuntu, Manjaro). Review of Naomi
Personal Voice Assistant. An intro to LISP.</p>
<p>Ran <em>GetTogether</em> in parallel with <em>Meetup.com</em>. No new uptake with
<em>GetTogether</em>. Run <em>GetTogether</em> for another year and evaluate. See if
<em>Meetup.com</em> changes their pricing.</p>
<p>Successfully changed the date for the AGM to January and registered this
with Incorporated Societies.</p>
<p>School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences were OK with sponsoring
the room for the 2021 year. They would like us to attract more Uni
students to come to WLUG meetings.</p>
<p>Members dropped from 12 to 11.</p>
<p>Peter moved that President's report be adopted and Roger agreed.</p>
<h2>Treasurer's Report</h2>
<p>Ian prepared and presented the Treasurer's Report. We had a small loss
for the year. Our regular expenses are the continuing of our domain name
registration and use of Meetup.com.</p>
<p>Our financial year is from 1st January to 31st December. Last AGM we
agreed to change the AGM date to January so the Treasurer’s Report
accurately covers transactions from 1 Jan to 31 Dec. The AGM being in
January has been updated with the Incorporated Societies Register.</p>
<p>Ian moved the Treasurer's Report be accepted and Peter seconded.
Unanimously agreed.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Review moving the AGM data from current Wiki to more secure

AGM's. Lawrence and Jacob will look into making these changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>University Engagement. Promote Open Source software, particularly if
its cross-platform. University students tend to exclusively using the
