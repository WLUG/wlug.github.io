<h2>Presidents Report</h2>
<p>Meetup.com listing has worked well to reach new members. This is a paid
$15/year listing. For the past year it has been mostly a social club.
New members have brought new talks over the year.</p>
<p>With the completed financial report we can now apply to re-register as
an incorporated society and update our charter.</p>
<p>Plan for the coming year - get more members on board, possibly look at
software freedom day.</p>
<h2>Treasurers Report</h2>
<p>Some corrections still needed to figures for subscriptions for
2010-2011. Tony to pass on documents to Michael to investigate
