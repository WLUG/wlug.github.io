<h1>4. Matters arising</h1>

<h1>5. President's report</h1>
<p>Lindsay Druett presented the President's report. He explained that the
year has passed very quickly; after being elected, he was very quickly
approached by members asking what the WLUG could do for new users. From
there the fixit workshops were born - thanks to BruceKingsbury for
arranging these events and to Bruce and his family for hosting most of
them.</p>
<p>Software Freedom Day was very well organised - thanks to CraigBox, as
well as IanMcDonald and Bruce for helping out - around 300 CDs were
given away to members of the public. We deliberately didn't run an
Installfest - the promotional part was done via SFD, and fixit workshops
have mostly taken the place of installfests, although it would be good
to again run an installfest in the next year.</p>
<p>We need to thank Orcon for taking over Hoiho's hosting last year, and HP
for donated us a server (through work done by Craig and Ian). We have
also invested in a good quality promotional banner.</p>
<p>Special thanks were made to Craig for 4 years of dedication to WLUG, and
also to Ian and Dave for their support this year, and Perry and Matthias
for their help on the committee.</p>
<p>He would like more members on the committee to take on more of a role -
for this, more support is needed. It is unfortunate that the election is
all a one horse race, with no no other people standing up (and none for
the secretary position!)</p>
<p>In closing, Lindsay wished to thanks everyone for being WLUG and
especially for everyones help in making SFD happen.</p>
