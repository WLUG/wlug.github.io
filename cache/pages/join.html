<h1>Membership of WLUG</h1>
<p>You are welcome to join our society for the annual fee of <strong>$10</strong>. Just fill out the on-line form below.</p>
<p>Membership contributes to the running costs of all sorts of things that the group offer. Also, you must be a member of the society to stand for executive committee positions and to vote at General Meetings.</p>
<p>Membership is currently set at $10 per year for an individual. Membership currently lasts from the time of payment until the next Annual General Meeting. Pro rata subscriptions are not offered.
