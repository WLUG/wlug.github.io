<p><em>The funds of the society shall be held under the control of the
officers of the committee. The treasurer and secretary shall have joint
required signing rights, and operate the bank accounts, handle
investments, and make payments as needed.</em></p>
<p>to:</p>
<p><em>The funds of the society shall be held under the control of the
officers of the committee. The officers shall have joint signing rights
with a minimum of two signatories required, and operate the bank
accounts, handle investments, and make payments as needed.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Passed U.</strong></p>
<h2>Election of Officers</h2>
<p>Some discussion about voting methods. AlexHope observes that vote by a
show of hands is the only only method allowed in the constitution.
BruceKingsbury suggests that we consider amending this next year if we
wish to allow other voting methods.</p>
<p>In the end there was only one nominee standing for each position and
three for committee so a simple show of hands was quite sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>President:</strong> Bruce Kingsbury - Passed</p>
<p><strong>Vice President:</strong> Lindsay Druett - Passed</p>
<p><strong>Secretary:</strong> Chris O'Halloran - Passed</p>
<p><strong>Treasurer:</strong> James Pluck - Passed</p>

<p>Proposed that Cairo Kingsbury be recognised as official penguin for
2007/2008 - Bruce Kingsbury / Lindsay Druett - Passed</p>
<p>The committee will once again consider the possibility of "Life
Members". Bruce Kingsbury is still opposed on the grounds that WLUG has
not existed long enough.</p>
