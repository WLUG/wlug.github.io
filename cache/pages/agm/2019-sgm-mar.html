<h2>Amend Charter</h2>
<p>We inadvertently removed the Common Seal section from Rules at the SGM
on 25 February 2019. Having a Common Seal is a requirement of the
Incorporated Societies Act of 1908. Peter proposed that the Common Seal
section be added back into the Rules. Ian seconded. Unanimously carried.</p>
<h2>Elect the Third Committee Member</h2>
<p>Ian proposed that Lawrence become our third committee member for 2019.
Seconded by Peter. Unanimously carried.</p>
<p>There was no general business and the meeting closed at 19:40.</p>
<p>After the meeting: Peter, Tony and Ian signed off on a printout of the
updated Rules for scanning and e-mailing to the Incorporated Societies
processing team.</p>
