## Introduction to *unsupported* Windows 11 CPU's

CPU's that may be available in the *Used Computer* market and suitable for running Linux. These tables should be helpful in selecting which computer to get based on CPU specifications.

## Links

* [Intel](../intel) CPU table. This table also provides links to the CPU data-sheets and mouse-over provides a messagebox with an expansion of the truncated data. Due to design of the Nikola websites display width, rows are multi-character in height.

* [Intel with sorting](../../intel_cpu_sort.html) of CPU table. This table provides sorting of the columns. Use an HD display to view all rows while having a single character height.  

* [AMD](../amd) CPU table. AMD CPU data specifications not provided at present.


## Information

For each release of Windows, Microsoft provides a list of the CPU's that are supported.

The latest Windows 11 release (24H2) provides a list of 781 Intel and 335 AMD CPU's that are *supported*. Refer to the [Intel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-24h2-supported-intel-processors) and [AMD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-24h2-supported-amd-processors) Windows 11 24H2 supported CPU lists.

Computers with CPU's that were *supported* in previous versions of Windows, may fail to upgrade to the latest version of Windows 11 if these computers use CPU's that are not included in the latest Windows *supported* list. 

From the Microsoft *supported* lists it is possible to make lists of the CPU's that have gone *unsupported*. Since 2015 there were 12 releases of Windows 10 and two releases of Windows 11 that preceed the latest Windows 11 24H2. The totals of CPU models in these previous lists that are no longer supported by Windows 11 24H2 are:

* 673 Intel
* 236 AMD

The *used computer* market should be boosted with computers using *unsupported* CPU's being discarded when Windows Users realise their computer hardware will no longer upgrade to the latest version of Windows 11. 

Most of these discarded computers will be suitable for running the latest Linux distros.
