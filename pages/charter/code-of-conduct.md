# Code of Conduct

The **Waikato Linux User Group (WLUG)** aims to foster an inclusive community which invites diverse groups of people from all backgrounds, regardless of age, body size, race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexuality, disability or religion to discuss and learn about all things Linux in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement.

We encourage all participants to create a friendly, welcoming environment for everyone involved. We expect participants to treat each other respectfully.

WLUG will not tolerate any intimidation, harassment, and/or any abusive, discriminatory behaviour by any participants. The use of inappropriate, derogatory, and/or offensive content/behaviour in any of these spaces is strictly prohibited.

The WLUG committee has the final decision on what is acceptable behaviour. A breach of conduct may lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal from the WLUG related events.

WLUG is aware of the responsibility required to ensure a successful and productive community now and in years to come, and will take appropriate measures after an incident occurs to prevent it from happening again.
