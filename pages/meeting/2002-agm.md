# Minutes of WLUG AGM - around 22 Jul 2002

OK, a summary of last nights meeting as I remember it (even though they
tell me I'm the WLUG secretary, it doesn't mean I wrote anything
down!)


The charter was discussed, Jamie will post up the changes to it later
(the unfinished version is at WlugIncorporated - check there later
perhaps) - some changes to the printed draft that was given out were
with regards to president having casting vote instead of veto rights,
the society not being a place for commercial pecuniary gain, rules about
kicking people off the list if they try and sell us too much stuff etc.
Daniel will summarise this later I hope.

We decided that a committee consisting of pres, vice-pres, secretary,
treasurer and 2n-1 members was required. Nominations for committee
members included Gavin Denby, Phil Murray, Greig McGill and Perry Lorier. We
also discussed that the mailing list administrator should have a
position ex-officio on the committee to represent the fact that the
mailing list is a large part of the society; therefore Kim Shepherd,
you're it.

The WLUG Wiki is now as close to an official WLUG webpage as ever has
been; it can be reached at the new domain of www.wlug.org.nz or the old
domain of wlug.linuxcare.co.nz. If you don't know what a wiki is, it's
a collaborative online system where anyone can edit any page and define
information (kind of like Everything2.com or BBC's Hitchhikers Guide to
the Galaxy at h2g2.com). Check it out, add some information about
yourself, but please try and be sensible - there's a lot of useless
information going up there now where it could be a much more useful
resource for Linux help and advocacy.

Unanimously accepted (though next time we should perhaps do it a bit
more seriously) were nominations for: 

* President: Daniel Lawson
* Vice-president: Jamie Curtis 
* Treasurer: Gavin Grieve 
* Secretary: Craig Box 
    
Hint: to find out more about these people or to add
information about them, go to http://www.wlug.org.nz/TheirName (as
defined above, for example http://www.wlug.org.nz/Craig Box is my node on
the wiki.)

The subscription fee will be $20; membership benefits are discussed in
the charter. Company memberships will not be issued, and no mention was
made of family memberships; with regard to that Gavin, I'd (personally)
suggest that seeing as membership isn't "required" to attend
meetings / use the mailing list, etc, you can subscribe yourself, and
perhaps make another donation on behalf of your family members, and if
wished to borrow books from the WLUG library then they could do so under
your name. **This will all be made official and subs will be collected
at the next meeting**. Please ensure that you bring your money --
Gavin Grieve will remind you of this nearer the time. Only paid members
have voting rights.

Craig Mckenna and Perry then discussed GnuPG (the open-source PGP clone)
and the way that keys and webs-of-trust work; a basic rundown is that I
sign Perry's key with my own to say "I trust Perry's key is valid and
that he is who he claims to be", and then when people get Perry's key,
even if they don't 'trust' Perry , they may trust me, so therefore
they can verify that his key is actually his. Check
[GPG/PGPNotes](http://wiki.wlug.org.nz/OpenPGP) for information, including an Outlook
Express GPG plugin.

News will come as it happens; however, the next meeting will probably
involve Gavin Grieve talking about Samba as a domain controller (which
I'd very much like to see BTW Gavin, and can even bring friends to!)
