## Amend Charter

We inadvertently removed the Common Seal section from Rules at the SGM
on 25 February 2019. Having a Common Seal is a requirement of the
Incorporated Societies Act of 1908. Peter proposed that the Common Seal
section be added back into the Rules. Ian seconded. Unanimously carried.

## Elect the Third Committee Member

Ian proposed that Lawrence become our third committee member for 2019.
Seconded by Peter. Unanimously carried.

There was no general business and the meeting closed at 19:40.

After the meeting: Peter, Tony and Ian signed off on a printout of the
updated Rules for scanning and e-mailing to the Incorporated Societies
processing team.
