Welcome to the **Waikato Linux Users Group (WLUG)**. We are based in Hamilton, New Zealand and initially provided for our Waikato region. All our work and presentations are done by volunteers.

Although our group originally focused on the Linux operating system, our focus has broadened to encompass all [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).

We have monthly meetings where we present a topic and afterward have topical discussions. We'd like to welcome you along to our meetings. For more information please see [Meetings](/meeting/).

We are an Incorporated Society. If you like become a member, then please apply at [Join](/join/).
